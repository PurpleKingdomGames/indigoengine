# Projects by Purple Kingdom Games

This repository contains the source code of all the officially supported Scala libraries and frameworks supported by Purple Kingdom Games, which includes:

### Indigo

Indigo is a game engine written in Scala for functional programmers. It allows game developers to build games using a set of purely functional APIs that are focused on productivity and testing.

Indigo is built entirely on Scala.js + WebGL, but it's sbt and Mill plugins will export games for web, desktop (via Electron), and mobile (via Cordova).

Documentation can be found at: [indigoengine.io](https://indigoengine.io).

### Tyrian

An Elm-inspired Scala UI library for Scala 3.

The main documentation site, complete with installation instructions, is available here:
[tyrian.indigoengine.io/](https://tyrian.indigoengine.io/)

### Ultraviolet

Ultraviolet is a Scala 3 to GLSL (versions 100 and 300) transpiler library built on top of Scala 3 inline macros.

Please visit the official [documentation site](https://ultraviolet.indigoengine.io/) for more details.

### Roguelike Starter Kit for Indigo

A starter project for Indigo to provide rendering functionality specifically for ASCII art style roguelike games.
